The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered from the near drowning, he wrote on a stoneToday my best friend saved my life.The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him; I hurt you, you wrote in the sand and now you write on a ston why The other friend replied When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it.Moral of the story: Don t value the things you have in your life.
